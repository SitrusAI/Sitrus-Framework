# Sitrus-Framework
Sitrus is an open source framework for creating apps and websites from a universal template, including:

- Super easy HTML page structure with routing
- HTML components (with nested component support)
- Dynamic reactivity directly in HTML with Alpine JS
- Style overrides directly in HTML with Tailwind CSS
- Centralized theme management in theme.css, with all style variables extended as Tailwind utility classes
- Semantic CSS classes and automatic theming of HTML selectors means writing less inline Tailwind than ever before! Realize beautiful interfaces with super condensed markup.
- Dark & light color modes
- And best of all it's all client-side—no build step or servers required!

This repo currently consists of a template project directory, which can be downloaded and run locally (i.e. using the Live Server extension in VS Code). Instructions and customization documentation to come.
