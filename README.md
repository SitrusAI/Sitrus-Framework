# Sitrus-Framework
Sitrus is an open source framework for creating apps and websites from a universal template, including:

-Super easy HTML page structure with routing
-HTML components (with nested component support)
-Dynamic reactivity directly in HTML with Alpine JS
-Style overrides directly in HTML with Tailwind
-Centralized theme management in theme.css
-Automatic styling to tons of selectors and semantic classes
-Dark & light color modes
-And best of all it's all client-side—no build step or servers required!

This repo currently consists of a template project directory, which can be downloaded and run locally (i.e. using the Live Server extension in VS Code). Instructions and customization documentation to come.

Check out sitrus.ai for AI-generated apps and websites leveraging this framework.
